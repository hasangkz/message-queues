## What is Message Queue?

Message queue is a structure used in software systems that enables asynchronous message communication between different components. It basically has three main components:

- **Producer**: Application or component that creates or sends messages.
- **Queue**: Data structure in which messages are temporarily stored and then held for consumption.
- **Consumer**: Application or component that processes or consumes messages.
